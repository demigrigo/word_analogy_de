In this repository we customized and trained a dataset in order to check word analogies, such as _Deutschland::Berlin_ _Ã–sterreich:: X?_ in the German language.
The dataset included the first 500000 rows of the original data.

The original dataset stemmed from Huggingface's German Wikipedia (https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia), called ("wikimedia/wikipedia", "20231101.de")
